# DFA String Acceptance Checker

**Objective:**  Implement a DFA that accepts binary strings ending with 01.

**Instructions:** 
1. Write a Java program that takes a binary string as input.
2. Simulate the DFA and print whether the string is accepted or rejected.

## Program Output
Input: `1101` → **Accepted**  
Input: `1110` → **Rejected**  
<br>
Both results show that the DFA accepts strings ending with `01`.
